# Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze economic indicators related to trade, specifically focusing on exports, imports, and the balance of goods and services over the years 2000 to 2010. The analysis involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to provide insights into trade dynamics.

## Key Features
- Analyze trends in exports and imports over time.
- Explore the relationship between different economic indicators.
- Visualize findings through various plots and charts.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The programming language used for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For advanced statistical data visualization.

## Installation
To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-analysis-project.git
   cd data-analysis-project
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Prepare Your Data**: Ensure your dataset is formatted correctly and placed in the appropriate directory.

2. **Run the Analysis**: Execute the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to perform the analysis and generate visualizations.
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook EDA.ipynb
   ```

3. **View Results**: Analyze the output and visualizations generated in the notebook.

## Visualizations
The analysis includes the following visualizations:
- **Line Plot**: Displays the trend of Balance Total over time.
- **Exports vs Imports Plot**: Compares exports and imports over the years.
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Shows the relationship between various economic indicators.
- **Bar Chart**: Compares the balance of goods and services for the years 2000 to 2010.
